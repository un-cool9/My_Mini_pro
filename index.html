                The shared storytelling palette known as the Marvel universe was unveiled in 1961, when
                Goodman responded to the growing interest in superhero books by commissioning writer <a
                    href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stan-Lee" target="_blank">
                    Stan Lee </a>and artist
                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jack-Kirby"> Jack Kirby </a>to create the <a
                    href=" https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fantastic-Four">Fantastic Four</a>. With the release of
                Fantastic Four no. 1 (November 1961),
                readers were introduced to a superheroic setting that was, nevertheless, rooted in the real world. Lee
                and Kirby attempted to make their comic book characters more original by allowing them to interact with
                each other in a realistic <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/fashion-society">fashion</a>,
                including heroes often fighting or arguing with each other. This
                trend continued with a flood of other superhero characters introduced by Marvel Comics during the early
                1960s, including <a
                    href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Spider-Man-comic-book-character">Spider-Man</a>, the
                Incredible Hulk, and the X-Men. Lee wrote the majority of Marvel’s
                books during that time, and Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko were the most important and influential artists.

                    href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/loki/on-screen">Loki</a> (Tom Hiddleston) arrives at a top
                secret SHIELD base, stealing an
                all-powerful alien Tesseract and turning both <a
                    href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/hawkeye-clint-barton"> Hawkeye</a> (Jeremy Renner) and Dr.
                Eric Selvig (Stellan
                Skarsgaard) into his zombiefied slaves.
                SHIELD director Nick Fury decides it's time to bring out the big guns. And when someone whose last name
                is "Fury" gets furious—well, you know that it's rage time.
                He and his team assemble a group of heroes to get the Tesseract back: unfrozen WWII hero Captain America
                (Chris Evans), celebrity billionaire Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and the ominously twitchy Dr. Bruce
                Banner (Mark Ruffalo).
                <br><br>
                They nab Loki in short order, thanks to the wayward god's "kneel before Zod" moment at a museum in
                Stuttgart. (When evil villains aren't monologuing, they find other ways of wasting precious
                villain-time.) But their trip back to base is interrupted by the arrival of the god Thor (Chris
                Hemsworth), there to take Loki back to Asgard and answer for all that horrible stuff he did in the
                original Thor. The heroes have a spat, but eventually agree to get Loki back to SHIELD's Helicarrier.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                After a successful raid on a HYDRA base, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner create an Artificial Intelligence
                called Ultron, a peacekeeping protocol designed to help the Avengers protect the world from their
                enemies. But things go wrong when Ultron sees the human race as a threat and sets out to destroy it
                along with the Avengers. Now the Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, Black Widow and
                Hawkeye, must reassemble to stop Ultron from causing mass destruction. Aside from this, the Avengers
                also must take on the powerful twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch as well as the new entity called
                Vision. Also, the Avengers find that things may never be the same again after discovering a power beyond
                their comprehension.<br><br>
                Since the events of the last film, the Avengers have been working to take down various cells of a secret
                society of villains known as HYDRA. Their zeal to make the world a better, safer place inspires Tony
                Stark, genius billionaire and alter ego of Iron Man, to create Ultron in order to respond to additional
                threats that the Avengers aren't able to handle. Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive too
                seriously -- he believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he'll stop
                at nothing to accomplish this goal. The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by
                the appearance of super-powered siblings Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who ally themselves with the
                homicidal android.

                With many people fearing the actions of super heroes, the government decides to push for the Hero
                Registration Act, a law that limits a hero's actions. This results in a division in The Avengers. Iron
                Man stands with this Act, claiming that their actions must be kept in check otherwise cities will
                continue to be destroyed, but Captain America feels that saving the world is daring enough and that they
                cannot rely on the government to protect the world. This escalates into an all-out war between Team Iron
                Man (Iron Man, Black Panther, Vision, Black Widow, War Machine, and Spider-Man) and Team Captain America
                (Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye, and Ant Man) while a new villain
                emerges.

                As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one
                hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic
                infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to
                inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this
                moment, the fate of Earth and existence has never been more uncertain.

            <p class="text">
                The film opens “pre-snap,” before Thanos (Josh Brolin) used the Infinity Stones to wipe out half of all
                life in the universe. Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is still on house arrest. He is spending
                a lovely day with his two sons, his wife (Linda Cardellini), and his daughter (whom he is teaching to
                use a bow and arrow). He turns his back for a moment and, when he turns around, he sees every member of
                his family has turned to dust . . .
                <br><br>
                Jump forward to after Infinity War. Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) is in a spaceship with
                Nebula (Karen Gillan). They are out of power and quickly running out of air. All seems lost until they
                float past Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). She tows them back to Earth where she had
                been summoned by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) before he was killed in the snap. They arrive and are
                greeted by what remains of the Avengers – Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans), Rocket Raccoon
                (voiced by Bradley Cooper/acted by Sean Gunn), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson),
                Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle), and Thor (Chris
                Hemsworth). They ask Tony if he has any info on Thanos and he freaks out, blaming Captain America’s
                going underground as the reason they lost. Tony essentially tells him they are on their own and goes off
                with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who also survived the snap.
